# Jolt

In physics, [jolt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)) is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time. It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction). Jolt is most commonly denoted by the symbol `j` and expressed in m/s<sup>3</sup> (SI units) or standard gravities per second (g<sub>0</sub>/s).

Custom [Revolt](https://www.github.com/revoltchat) client for desktop made in Tauri and Svelte.

## Build

### Prerequisites

To build Jolt for your own machine, first run the following command to install NPM packages: `npm install`, then you need some prerequisites, they are included in the [`shell.nix`](shell.nix) and [`flake.nix`](flake.nix) files. If you are on NixOS, just run `nix develop` (recommended) or `nix-shell shell.nix`. If not, you will have to install the packages and libraries listed [`shell.nix`](shell.nix) or [`flake.nix`](flake.nix) and add the libraries to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable (see `shellHook` in [`flake.nix`](flake.nix) or [`shell.nix`](shell.nix)).

### Build Process

Edit the [Tauri configuration file](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) and change `beforeBuildCommand` to the NPM package manager of your choice then run the following command (adapting to the NPM package manager of your choice):

```bash
pnpm run tauri build # (or "npm run tauri dev", "yarn run tauri dev", etc.)
```

## Development Server

If you want to test the application before building it, you can run it in a development server.

First, edit the [Tauri configuration file](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) and change `beforeDevCommand` to the NPM package manager of your choice and then run the following command (obviously, adapting to the NPM package manager of your choice):

```bash
pnpm run tauri dev # (or "npm run tauri dev", "yarn run tauri dev", etc.)
```
